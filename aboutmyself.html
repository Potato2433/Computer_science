        About me
    </h1>
    <body>
        My name is Tejasvini Vikram but I like to be called Tejas. My birthday is 07/07/08.
        I like watching Winnie The Pooh and Octonauts in my free time. I like blowing bubbles. 
        My hobbies include reading, drawing and writing. When I'm bored I like to pretend I'm a cloud.
        My MBTI type is INTP. I like watching anime and movies. I'm learning to play the violin. 
        I don't think I'm that good. I have no long term goals yet. I don't know what I want to be when I grow up.
        I have pets. I have 2 hamsters callled Ham and Gold, one dog called Spike and a bird called Iggywick.
        All my best friends are animals or plants. My mom says I should have more human friends. 
        I like eating sweet things. I am a potato. I have nothing else to say. Bye.
